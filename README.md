# PyDYCO

**PyDYCO** is a thermodynamic solver primarily used for thermoelectricity, with the acronym standing for **Dynamique Coupl√©e**. This solver leverages **Spice** and **Python** to calculate the coupling between energy current and electric current in 2D materials.

## Features

- **Coupling Calculation**: PyDYCO computes the interaction between energy and electric currents in 2D materials.
- **Temperature and Electrochemical Potential**: The solver helps find the local temperature and electrochemical potential in the material.
- **Current Distribution**: It calculates the different currents in the material, providing valuable insights into thermoelectric properties.

## Technologies Used

- **Spice** for circuit simulation.
- **Python** for solving and computation.
